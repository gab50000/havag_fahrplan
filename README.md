# havag_fahrplan
Checks the Havag Website for trams

Use this script on your Raspberry Pi to display the next departures from near your home. It has touchscreen support and updates automatically from the internet. At the moment, it only works with the website www.havag.com (a German transport company), but it should not be too difficult to fit it to your needs.

You can see a small demonstration video here: https://player.vimeo.com/video/129365821
